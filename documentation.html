          <h2>Project: myFlix</h2>
          <p></p>
          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>Develop the server-side component of a web application focused on movies. This application will allow users to access information about various movies, directors, and genres. Users will have the ability to sign up, update their personal details, and curate a list of their favorite movies.</p>
          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>This project involves creating a REST API for a web application called "myFlix," which interacts with a database containing movie data. Subsequently, the client-side component of the application will be built using REACT. By completing this project, you will showcase proficiency in full-stack JavaScript development, including APIs, web servers, databases, authentication, and more, using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.</p>
          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>The following sections provides information about the requirements for the app.</p>
          <h3>The 5 Ws</h3>
          <p>    Who - Immediate users include frontend developers and enthusiasts of the myFlix application who seek information about movies.
            What - The server-side component comprises the server, business logic, and business layers of the application. It involves building a well-designed REST API and database using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
            When - The server-side operates whenever users interact with myFlix, processing their requests and managing data operations.
            Where - The application will be hosted online and is responsive, ensuring accessibility across various devices.
            Why - Movie enthusiasts desire access to movie-related information, which the myFlix server-side component facilitates by processing requests and storing data efficiently.
